# SumoControl
Simple node app to control the Jumping Sumo from Parrot.
(I prefer arrows instead of moving my iPad...)

To install, run :
- npm install

To run :
- connect to the drone wifi
- run : npm start

Then your browser will open and display the following URL http://127.0.0.1:3000.
Use the arrow keys to move your drone, space for high jump, shift for tap and the top buttons on the page for other moves.
